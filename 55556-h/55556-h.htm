</div>

<p class='c011'>“Stranger than the tales of the Arabian Nights—indeed,
almost Munchausen-like in its seemingly improbable character
is the tale I am about to give you in truth,” said Captain
Nicodemus Beere as he hitched up his trowsers and
shifted his quid.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., drew a deep, quick breath and looked
keenly at his visitor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is a sweeping statement,” he declared; “but you
are a truthful man, Captain Beere, and of course you mean
what you say.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I certainly do,” said the doughty captain in his most
positive manner. “What is more, I stand ready to furnish
undisputed proof of it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain cleared his throat and began his story. But
before we follow him through its thread let us take a closer
look at him.</p>

<p class='c000'>It could be seen at a glance that he was a man much out
of the ordinary.</p>

<p class='c000'>In figure he was stout and well built, with fair features
and a heavy, full beard. His blue eyes twinkled with honesty
but a certain irascibility of temper peculiar to sea-faring
men.</p>

<p class='c000'>For many years he had sailed the seas and weathered
many a hard voyage in all quarters of the world. But two
years previous he had retired with the purpose of spending
the rest of his days in ease and comfort on shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had been a warm friend of Frank Reade, Sr., long
since passed away, and when he heard of the success of
Frank Reade, Jr., the son of the famous inventor, he conceived
the notion of paying him a visit.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., received him hospitably in his beautiful
Readestown home.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My father’s friends are mine,” he declared. “I have
often heard him speak of you, Captain Beere.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain visited the great machine shops of Frank
Reade, Jr., and inspected his various inventions. Among
them the one which claimed his deepest interest was the
new air-ship, the Spectre.</p>

<p class='c000'>And as he studied and admired it an idea came into his
brain. He at once was determined to broach it to the young
inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>This idea was to be embodied in the tale which he now
proposed to give Frank, and with this explanation let us follow
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ten years ago,” declared the captain, “I was master of
as fine a ship as ever rounded Cape Horn. We were south of
Panama and somewhere off the coast of Peru when a storm
struck us.</p>

<p class='c000'>“For four days and nights it roared and howled and bellowed.
We were buffeted and driven hither and thither,
half the time running before the wind. We could not tell
where we were nor what would be the end of it all. It
seemed as if we must go to the bottom.</p>

<p class='c000'>“On the fourth day the climax came. The foremast went
by the board and carried the maintop with it. Later the
main also went and we were almost dismasted. Moreover,
the ship began to make water at a fearful rate.</p>

<p class='c000'>“However, by working sharp we kept her afloat until the
morning of the fifth day, which broke clear and bright. On
our weather bow we saw land.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There was no hope of saving the ship, so we worked her
down under a jury rig until we found a good place to beach
her. Then we went ashore in a long-boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was a rough, wild coast, with terrible high cliffs and
reaches of sand. Of course we climbed the highest cliff to
see what was about us.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Westward was the sea. North and south the rough
shore, but eastward was a mountainous country with fearful
mountain passes and gorges. There was something weird
and mystic about the whole region. But we knew that it
was death from starvation to stay by the shore, so we kept
on looking for signs of human settlement.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Before we knew it we were deep in the heart of the
strangest region any of us had ever seen. Every cliff or
precipice seemed to have the shape of a fiend or a hobgoblin
or an elf. The trees were fantastic in shape, there were
hideous plants and snake-like vines. At times we came to
sluggish streams and deep pools with strange, black depths,
apparently bottomless.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The animals were of an unknown species. There were
birds of a talking species, yet unlike parrots. I cannot half
describe to you the wonders of this mysterious country.</p>

<p class='c000'>“For months we wandered through it. Then we came
upon the ruins of a city and all the signs of a former civilization.
We also discovered that the mountains were haunted
by a race of giants, wild barbarians, out of whose way we
took care to keep.</p>

<p class='c000'>“After a time we came to a mighty inland sea or lake,
the farther shore of which was so far distant that we could
not see it. By the shores of this we sojourned many days.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But one morning we arose to view a strange state of
affairs. Where a few hours before there had existed a
mighty lake, we saw now naught but a deep, rocky and
sandy basin.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The water had disappeared and hills and valleys lay in
its place. It was a mighty surprise to us. All sorts of theories
were advanced.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That some subterranean channel had opened and carried
the water away looked logical. Or perhaps a chasm or barrier
at some far end had given way, and the mighty volume
had been diverted into another and lower basin.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Any or all of these theories looked plausible enough, and
were accepted without further question. We spent a number
of days exploring the basin. By some strange instinct
we returned each night from the basin to our camp. To
this we owed our lives.</p>

<p class='c000'>“One day while wandering about the basin, one of our
party came upon a curious object.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was a structure of rocks closely fitted together with
cement. It was half imbedded in a plain of sand. That
it was the work of human hands there could be no doubt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of course we were all interested, for it showed that at
some time other human beings than ourselves had visited
the spot. We at once began to curiously examine the structure.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This resulted in a thrilling discovery. It was undoubtedly
hollow and our first mate, Bill Langley, discovered a
movable stone at its summit. He displaced this, and a
great cavity was revealed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Our first thought, of course, was that it was a tomb or
burial place of some extinct race. In looking into the place
we would not have been surprised to have come across a
heap of old bones or other such evidence.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But what we did see was far different. Bill leaned over
the aperture a while and rubbed his eyes repeatedly. Then
he slid down, and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“’By jingo, mates! I’m a gallivantin’ old shark, if there
ain’t a heap of gold in that ere place!’</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Gold!’ I exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’With submission, sir!’</p>

<p class='c000'>“’You are dreaming, man!’ I exclaimed somewhat excited.
’Do you mean it?’</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Every word, skipper,’ replied Bill, solemnly. And I
saw that he meant just what he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This was enough for me. So I climbed upon the mound
and looked in also. Something bright and yellow struck my
gaze. I gave a gasp and then I cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Give me a rope, mates. Steady me while I go down
there!’</p>

<p class='c000'>“And with a rope around my waist I slid down into the
mound. It did not require but a few moments to satisfy me
that we had discovered buried treasure.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir, gold! Yellow, glittering stuff, enough to make
us all millionaires. I own that I was near crazy at the
time. There it lay in bars and ingots. All that was left
was to take it away to civilization.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I crawled out of the mound and then we all sat down
and discussed the matter. There were fifteen of us.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bill Langley proposed a fair division. Of course this
was satisfactory. Then it was decided to take the gold out
of the mound.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The gold fever was upon us; we worked like badgers at
it. In a few hours we had a heap of the stuff piled up beside
the mound. Then nightfall began to threaten. We
suspended work, and it was decided not to return to camp,
but remain on the spot until morning. There was not the
remotest chance of anybody’s purloining the gold, yet all
wanted to stay there.</p>

<p class='c000'>“However, much of our necessary utensils were at the old
camp. It was about three miles distant. At length Bill
Langley and I decided to return for them and come back in
the morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So we set out for the old camp, and reached there an
hour later, much fatigued. We lit a fire and sat down by
it; but we could not sleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>“All we could do was to talk about the treasure and what
golden plans we could lay for the future. Midnight came
and passed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then I began to feel a bit drowsy, and suggested turning
in; but the words hadn’t left my lips when Bill gave a
quick start.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Great gunnels, mate!’ he exclaimed; ’what in the Old
Harry was that?’</p>

<p class='c000'>“The same sound came to my ears. It was a distant,
monotonous boom like rolling thunder. The ground actually
shook under our feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Only once had I heard a similar frightful sound, and
that was once during an earthquake in Panama. But was
this an earthquake?</p>

<p class='c000'>“We sprang to our feet. Bill picked up a fire brand and
held it high. But we could see nothing but a few faint stars
overhead. It was the blackest kind of a night.</p>

<p class='c000'>“For a space of thirty minutes the same dull roaring and
trembling continued. Then came a dead silence.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We had about given up interest in the matter, thinking
it some inexplicable phenomenon of a tropical clime, when a
sudden, startling thing happened.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A terrific boom, and a swirling, rushing mass came
whooping down through the lake basin. The next moment
we were picked up as if in giant arms and carried clean to
the summit of the eminence beyond us, and there we clung
to palm trees, wet as drowned rats.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='II' class='c008'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <span class='large'>FRANK MAKES A DECISION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The captain shifted his quid again and then smiled at the
earnest look in Frank’s eyes. The young inventor was intensely
interested.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How did we get wet?” interrogated the captain. “Water
of course. It was all before us. It had come down upon us
with the force of a hurricane.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We waited where we were until the light of day came.
Then we beheld an appalling scene. A mighty expanse of
water lay before us.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The lake had come back. The basin was full of water.
Evidently it had a trick of doing this. That it was of the
transient kind there was no doubt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I won’t attempt any theorizing or explanation of the
phenomenon. I describe it to you just as it occurred. That
is all. You’ll have to guess the rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What of our shipmates and the gold? I don’t know. We
never saw them again. We could do nothing but push on to
the northward. For months we wandered until we came
to a great river leading down to the Paraguay. Thence we
made our way to Parana and shipped home. This is my
story.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank drew a deep breath.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a moment after the captain had finished he could not
speak. At length he managed to say:</p>

<p class='c000'>“You think the gold is still at the bottom of that lake?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And that the lake is transient, or has spells of changing
its basin?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Just so, mate!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was thoughtful for a moment. Finally he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you think it would be easy to find that locality
again?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, there’s the rub,” said Beere, rubbing his hands; “in
my lifetime I have made six attempts and failed. But, of
course, we traveled overland.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The same thought came to each.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then you think the air-ship—on account of a better view
of the earth, could locate it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do,” replied Nicodemus. “Now you have the whole
thing in a nutshell, Frank. The moment I looked at your
air-ship, I saw a possible way to visit the mysterious country
and locate the Transient Lake.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., seemed for a moment in a glow. His
eyes shone like blazing stars, and his manner was all eagerness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By Jove, you have done it, Captain Nicodemus!” he
declared. “I have been trying to decide upon a new trip
with the Spectre, and to visit the Transient Lake is just
the thing. It promises eager anticipation, excitement and
thrilling adventure.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain leaned over the table.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You will go?” he asked, tensely.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And—will you allow me to go with you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I would not think of going without you!” declared
Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you! I had quit the sea, and never thought to
take another voyage. But a cruise in the air—that’s different,
mate. When shall I report?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We will start within a week,” declared Frank; “it will
not take long to get things in readiness. I will have Barney
and Pomp put stores on board at once.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We will not dwell upon the further conversation which
followed. Suffice it to say that before the old captain left
Readestown all arrangements were made.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney O’Shea was a jolly Irish boy, who had been long
in the employ of Frank Reade, Jr. Pomp was a negro
valet who was as devoted to Frank as man could be.</p>

<p class='c000'>Wherever Frank traveled these two faithful chaps accompanied
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank’s first move after the departure of Captain Nicodemus
was to ring a bell. Instantly it was answered by
Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Celt stood in the doorway and ducked his red head
in response to Frank’s call.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, here I am, sor!” he declared.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where is Pomp?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Celt gave a queer little whistle. Almost instantly a
comical little darky appeared beside him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here I is, sah!” he said, with a scrape and a grin.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, you jolly rascals,” said Frank, with a laugh. “I
have some good news for you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly, Marse Frank, wha’ am it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers, it’s glad we are to hear that, sor!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” said Frank, quickly, “I want you to have the
Spectre ready for a quick departure. We are bound for a
cruise to South America.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney threw a handspring, and Pomp cut a pigeon-wing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hi, hi!” cried the darky; “dat am jes’ too good news
fo’ anyfing!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be me sowl, I’m deloighted!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Put provisions aboard the Spectre at once,” ordered
Frank. “See that she is completely equipped for a long
cruise. You know what to do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Away scampered the two jolly fellows. So high were
their spirits that they bubbled over, and before the yard of
the machine works was crossed they fell to wrestling with
each other.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hi, hi, chile!” sputtered Pomp, getting a grapevine on
the Celt; “I kin trow yo’ jes’ as easy as yo’ like. Look out
dar fo’ squalls!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not much, me friend,” retorted Barney, securing an
elbow lock. “One—two—three—an’ over yez go!”</p>

<p class='c000'>They rolled around the yard for somewhile like a couple
of monkeys. Neither desisted until they were completely
exhausted; then each sped away to do Frank’s bidding.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I git square wif yo’ yet, yo’ no ’count I’ishman,” cried
Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yez aren’t the soize,” retorted Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the great, high-roofed storehouse the Spectre rested
upon her stocks.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was a marvel of beauty and symmetry. Her lines
were somewhat like those of a government cruiser, yet more
narrow of beam and slender.</p>

<p class='c000'>The hull was of thinly rolled composition of aluminum
and steel to insure lightness and make it impervious to a
bullet. The hull was pierced just below the rail with a
number of dead-eye windows, which admitted light to the
hold.</p>

<p class='c000'>Above the deck there arose two cabins. The forward
cabin was richly furnished, and contained the dining saloon
and the living quarters of the ship’s company.</p>

<p class='c000'>The after cabin contained the staterooms and berths. It
was provided with dead-eye windows, and could be made
airtight in the event of the air-ship ascending into the rarefied
atmosphere above the clouds, where human life could
not be supported.</p>

<p class='c000'>Forward was the pilot-house, a dome-shaped structure
with heavy plate glass windows. In this were the steering
gear and electric keyboard, with all nautical and scientific
instruments suitable for navigation in the air.</p>

<p class='c000'>The propelling power of the air-ship was furnished by
electric motors placed in the hold. These drove a huge fan
propeller at the stern.</p>

<p class='c000'>Also they drove the four powerful helices placed upon
revolving masts above the deck. These furnished the lifting
power of the air-ship, which was most tremendous.</p>

<p class='c000'>Everything about the Spectre was ship-shape and elegant,
from the polished brass-work to the silver-bladed helices and
shiny steel masts. It was a marvel of beauty and grace and
appointment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having said this much we will close this brief and incomplete
description of the great air-ship, leaving the reader to
gather a more correct impression from the accurate representation
of the artist.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few evenings thereafter Frank received the following
telegram from Captain Nicodemus:</p>

<hr class='c012' />
<p class='c000'>“Dear Frank—Am all ready for the start. Shall I come
to Readestown or will you stop for me at New Orleans,
where I am at present? Wire me.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Yours, &#8196; &#8196; &#8196; <span class='sc'>Nicodemus Beere</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c000'>Frank at once answered that he would pick the captain
up at New Orleans on the way to the Gulf. Then he hastened
preparations for the start.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not long before the air-ship was rolled out into the
great yard and was all ready for the start.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the people of Readestown rose en masse to give their
distinguished fellow-citizen an ovation and a grand farewell
to speed him on his journey.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fame of the undertaking had traveled far and wide
and from every part of the country people flocked to Readestown.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their curiosity was most powerful to see the man who
had mastered so easily the great problem of aerial navigation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was obliged to decline all invitations to events
given in his honor. His full time was occupied in preparations
for the start.</p>

<p class='c000'>And at last all was ready.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank wired Beere at New Orleans and then went aboard
the air-ship. Barney and Pomp accompanied him.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a beautiful August morning. A mighty crowd
thronged the streets of Readestown to get a look at the air-ship
as it mounted in the air.</p>

<p class='c000'>None of them were disappointed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Exactly at the hour named the Spectre leaped upward
into the clouds. The people cheered and the bands played
and cannon roared. And away sailed the Spectre.</p>

<p class='c000'>Into space she sped, every moment growing smaller, until
soon she was lost to sight altogether.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great journey was begun.</p>

<p class='c000'>The voyagers were destined to meet with many thrilling
adventures ere they should see home again. What these
were it will be our duty to chronicle.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, she sails foine!” said Barney with delight, as
he trimmed the course of the air-ship a bit; “she’ll niver be
beat, Misther Frank!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think myself that she sails well,” said the critical
young inventor. “I shall not try to beat her this year.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly, Marse Frank, yo’ don’t hab no need ter,” declared
Pomp; “she am good fo’ a long voyage, sah!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, phwere is it we will be afther meetin’ the
other man?” asked Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“At New Orleans,” replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“An’ how far is that, sor?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“About a thousand miles. We will make it in two days
easy enough.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is on our course, sor?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The air-ship sailed on over a mighty panorama of mountain
and valley, hill and plain, lake and forest and river.
Great cities alternated with little towns. It was a mighty
spectacle from the air-ship’s deck.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='III' class='c008'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class='large'>IN THE ANDES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Be me sowl, it’s a big country Ameriky is!” declared
Barney, as he glanced over the rail. “Shure, it’ll take a
heap av foightin’ to iver conquer her!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The days of national conquest are over, I guess,” said
Frank. “At least I hope so. That is a custom relegated
to the dark ages.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hard luck fer ould Oireland,” declared the Celt; “shure
av it was to-day she was free, England wud niver conquer
her thin.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly! yo’ might borrow dis air-ship from Marse Frank
an’ set yo’ island free if yo’ wanted to,” declared Pomp;
“shuah, yo’ cud blow up de hull lot ob dem Britishers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney’s eyes blazed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers, it’s no more thin they desarve, bad cess to
thim,” he declared. “Shure, they’ve had their feet on sufferin’
Oireland’s neck long enuff.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And so Barney continued to dilate upon the wrongs, real
and fancied, of his native isle. He kept on until Pomp
began to guy him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he got angry.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Huh!” cried the darky, “if yo’ people was set free dey
nebber cud govern demselves! Shuah dey wud be eatin’
each other up fo’ a fac’!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Phwat’s that yez say?” blustered Barney, angrily;
“don’t yez cast no aspersions on the ould sod, yez black
pickaninny! Shure yez own people wud niver have got free
av it hadn’t been fer Gineral Lincoln!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dat shows all yo’ know ’bout fings,” sniffed Pomp;
“dar warn’t no sich man as Gineral Linkum.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hey! phwat’s that, naygur? Don’t yez give me de
lie!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Huh! Linkum warn’t no gineral, sah! He was de
President, I’d hab yo’ know, sah!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney elevated his nose contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be me sowl it’s mighty little yez know onyway. An’
ain’t the President commander-in-chief av the army an’
navy? An’ don’t that make him the bigges’ gineral in the
land?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp saw the point and wilted. He slunk into the galley,
muttering:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I jes’ fix dat I’ishman fo’ pretendin’ to know so much.
I jes’ hab a dose ready fo’ him yet!”</p>

<p class='c000'>What this was we must wait for a later hour to decide.
For the present we will consider nearer incidents.</p>

<p class='c000'>In due course New Orleans was sighted. The air-ship
hung over the southern city.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank looked for a certain signal, which he saw finally
upon the roof of one of the houses.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a yellow flag.</p>

<p class='c000'>At once the air-ship bore down upon it and soon descended
within fifty feet of the roof. Up through a skylight
popped Captain Nicodemus.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ahoy the ship!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ahoy!” replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am ready to come aboard. Throw out your gangway!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is that roof strong enough to bear the weight of the
air-ship?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Surely, mate! Come down.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank let the air-ship descend and rest upon the roof of
the building. Then he sprang down and shook hands with
the captain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nicodemus was delighted.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was all equipped for the trip.</p>

<p class='c000'>But his personal appearance was startling as well as
amusing in the extreme.</p>

<p class='c000'>The old captain had got himself up in the style of the
privateer captain of forty or fifty years previous. He wore
fancy high boots, clinging cutlass, pistols in belt, a velvet
blouse and pea-jacket.</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked as if equipped for a privateering or piratical
cruise, and Frank could not help a smile.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You look as if you expected trouble,” he exclaimed.
“Why have you armed yourself?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hang me high!” cried the captain, fiercely; “are we
not going into a land full of sharks and cuttlefish? Keep
your eye on your outfit, lad. We will need a little powder
and ball and cold steel before we get home.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” said Frank, “you may be right; but I never employ
arms until the necessary time comes. You are taking
time by the forelock.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Which is correct, skipper. I once knew a fair ship to
become overrun with pirates out in the Maldives, just because
the skipper would not carry powder for fear of blowing
up the ship. He had an aversion to the smell.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank could not but laugh.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” he agreed, “you may be right. However, this
air-ship is an adjunct of Liberty Hall, so that you are all
right. Keep your eye out for sharks.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Depend on it, skipper. But will we wait long at this
port?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not another moment,” declared Frank; “let us be off at
once.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He made a motion to Barney and the air-ship left the
roof. As it soared aloft, the streets below were seen to be
crowded with curious people craning their necks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon the Spectre was sailing over the jetties and the
delta of the Mississippi, and beyond were seen the waters of
the Gulf.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Nicodemus walked the deck of the air-ship, completely
in his element.</p>

<p class='c000'>He sniffed the air and leveled his long glass at the distant
horizon.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This beats ocean navigation all to pieces,” he declared.
“There’s nothing like an air-ship.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then you like it better than the sea?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why not, skipper? In the first place, you can sail faster.
You are surer of making port on time. There’s no
sails to furl or set. It’s handsome sailing, and no care for
the wind.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank saw the old captain’s logic, and was inclined to
agree with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are right, captain,” he said. “Aerial navigation
beats all else. But looking into the future, what shall we
make a bee line for when we get across this gulf?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“For the Andes of Peru, then follow on down their
eastern slope. I think by so doing we shall come to the mysterious
country.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very good. But how will you identify the Transient
Lake if the water is all out of it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Trust me for that, skipper, I could never fail to locate
it. I hope the water is out of it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We could then easily follow the basin’s course and find
the gold.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can see. Well, keep a sharp outlook when we reach
the Andes. I shall strike across the Caribbean Sea for the
mountains of Peru.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good! I feel sure of success!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The air-ship swept on southward. In due time the coast
of Cuba hove into view.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon its western end was Cape San Antonio. Frank
passed directly over this and entered upon the Caribbean
Sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was evident now that they were well into the tropics.
The air was balmy and the sea limpid and still.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the coast of Colombia came into view the exciting
period seemed to have been reached. Beyond all knew that
the land of wild adventure lay.</p>

<p class='c000'>On sailed the Spectre.</p>

<p class='c000'>Over the coast it passed and into the interior of Colombia.
The scenery was grand, and of the typical sort peculiar to
South America.</p>

<p class='c000'>And still the Spectre kept on until great dreamy-looking
peaks rose from the western horizon.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Andes!”</p>

<p class='c000'>All crowded to the rail, and with thrilling veins regarded
the range of wonderful mountains, in fact, the most wonderful
in the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Andes of Peru upon the eastern slope are peculiarly
rough and picturesque.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was in these mighty fastnesses that the ancient Incas
had built their temples and held their own in battle with
the lawless Spaniard, until their wealth, their glory and
their prestige was forever lost to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mighty Sarata with its altitude of 21,286 feet, gigantic
Illimani with its 21,000 feet, the great volcano of Guallatieri
with 22,000 feet, Titicaca, Vilcanata, Misti and all the
monarchs of that awful aggregation of peaks, than which
the world has no superior, were all about the air-ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gliding from one fleecy cloud to another, the jagged
heights in their solemn grandeur were visible only at intervals.
Captain Beere could hardly contain himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By the horn spoon!” he cried. “When you can find
anything to equal this, I’ll like to know where it can be. Is
it not powerful, mates?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed it is!” replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>All of the voyagers wore a face mask, an invention of
Frank Reade, Jr.’s, for use in high altitudes to prevent
bleeding of the respiratory organs or faintness. It was impregnated
with a chemical, which, placed in a light porous
sponge at the nostrils, was a sure remedy.</p>

<p class='c000'>So that they were enabled to travel with impunity in that
high atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have heard great reports of the malady encountered in
the high Andes, known as the mountain sickness,” said
Nicodemus; “it don’t seem to trouble us as yet, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is easily understood,” said the young inventor;
“we are in the air, and consequently do not feel the pressure
as we would if we stood on the mountain summit or terra
firma. The buoyancy of the air-ship overcomes that peculiar
pressure which causes the so-called mountain sickness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The air-ship sailed on slowly among the great peaks. It
was a wonderful spectacle.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the aerial voyagers soon tired of it, and Frank finally
asked:</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you think, Nicodemus? Is the mysterious
country south of us?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think so, skipper,” replied the captain. “We kept a
pretty straight line eastward to the head waters of the
Paraguay River; we ought to find the Transient Lake somewhere
south of us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We will keep on then in that direction,” said Frank.
“Heigho! What is that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The air-ship gave a sudden mad plunge forward. There
was a terrific explosion in the distance like the boom of a
hundred great guns.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the wave of air coming from that direction which
had given the motion to the Spectre. But this was not all.</p>

<p class='c000'>From a cloud just above the air-ship blazing balls of fire
suddenly shot downward.</p>

<p class='c000'>A tremendous crash ensued on the air-ship’s deck, and
she reeled and shot downward.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='IV' class='c008'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE FIGHT WITH THE PUMA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The air-ship was falling.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a moment horror was upon all in the little party.
It was a terrible realization, for below, thousands of feet,
they might be dashed to atoms upon jagged ledges.</p>

<p class='c000'>A powerful missile had fallen from the cloud and struck
full and fair in the air-ship’s bow. The shock had thrown
open the pilot-house door.</p>

<p class='c000'>The helices had ceased to revolve but slowly and the air-ship
was floating downward with speed. For one awful
second the aerial voyagers knew not what move to make.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Frank Reade, Jr., acted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quick as a flash he sprang into the pilot-house. Barney,
who was at the wheel, had been knocked half senseless to
the deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>One glance told Frank the truth. The shock of the falling
missile had caused the helix lever to fly shut and had
shut off the electric current. This had checked the speed of
the helices and allowed the air-ship to fall.</p>

<p class='c000'>With one leap Frank reached the keyboard.</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned the lever swiftly and to his horror found that
it was bent. However, the downward speed of the ship was
materially checked.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next moment there was a shock and she rested upon
the ground. Then Frank shut off the current entirely.</p>

<p class='c000'>He sprang out of the pilot-house and glanced about to see
that they were resting safely upon a broad expanse of ledge
on the mountain side.</p>

<p class='c000'>Below them sloped the mountain for miles into green valleys.
The danger was over.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be me sowl!” gasped Barney, as he crawled to his feet;
“phwat the divil was it that was afther hitting me? Shure
it med me dizzy the while.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hang me high!” roared Nicodemus, “I thought our
bones were spoiled for that! How did we escape?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was a close call,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly! Wha’ was dat struck us?” interrogated Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’ll find out!” said Frank, as he advanced to the bow.</p>

<p class='c000'>And there the cause of the mischief was found. This was
in the shape of a huge fragment of volcanic rock which had
cut its way half through the deck plates, and was so firmly
imbedded that it required great strength to dislodge it.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was only one of the score or more aerolites which had
fallen from the sky.</p>

<p class='c000'>That they might have been hurled aloft from the distant
volcano there was a strong likelihood. That no worse damage
was done was fortunate.</p>

<p class='c000'>The air-ship rested safely enough upon the ledge of rock.
Frank proceeded at once to repair the injury.</p>

<p class='c000'>While he was working at the keyboard, Nicodemus and
Barney bethought themselves that it was a good opportunity
for an exploring tour over the ledges.</p>

<p class='c000'>So they took their rifles and climbed over the rail. They
had descended to an altitude now where the air was not so
rare, or there was little danger of the deadly mountain
sickness.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had spied some mountain goats and the captain
was anxious to get a shot at them.</p>

<p class='c000'>So they proceeded some distance down the mountain side
until the air-ship was lost to sight. The view at this point
was very grand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Far below there were great slopes of green, alternating
with shelving rock. In the vista beyond a mighty green
valley extended to the base of other mountains seventy or
eighty miles away.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such scenery could hardly be eclipsed anywhere else in
the world. The two men could not help but gaze upon it
with wonderment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be me sowl,” averred Barney, “it’s a long way down
there.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is true,” agreed Nicodemus. “I wouldn’t care to
walk it. But—hello! what is that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain came to a sudden halt, and raised his gun
with one finger ready on the trigger.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was good cause for this. Along the mountain wall
there was creeping toward them a huge black form flattened
against the ledges.</p>

<p class='c000'>It required but a glance for the captain to recognize the
deadly foe of the South American traveler, the puma, or
mountain lion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The creature was bent upon attacking them, as could be
readily seen. It was a moment of peril.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Separate!” said the captain sharply, moving to the
right. “Keep your eyes open, Barney!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All roight, sor!”</p>

<p class='c000'>This movement seemed for a moment to disconcert the
puma. It seemed in a quandary as to what direction to
take.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally it moved toward Barney. The Celt got behind a
bowlder.</p>

<p class='c000'>He held his rifle ready for use, and his shock of red hair
stood literally on end.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be me sowl!” he muttered, “av the vilyun gets his
clutches on me, shure it’s lost I am! I’m afther thinkin’
I’ll niver give him that chance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Nicodemus, meanwhile, had been getting a line
on the beast.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Steady, Barney!” he cried. “I’ll give him a shot. If he
turns for me you give him another!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All roight, sor!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Nicodemus drew straight and careful aim. Then he
pulled the trigger.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crack!</p>

<p class='c000'>Where the bullet struck the puma it was not easy to say.
But the animal gave a quick snarling cry and wheeled
about.</p>

<p class='c000'>He raised himself a trifle from the ground. It was Barney’s
chance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bad cess to ye!” he muttered, and drew quick aim.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crack!</p>

<p class='c000'>Another bullet struck the puma. But the animal had already
made its spring. Straight for the covert of its human
foe it shot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Nicodemus saw that his life hung in the balance.
He did not shirk the responsibility.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a momentous occasion.</p>

<p class='c000'>He raised himself and took cool and steady aim. If his
bullet hit the mark he would stop the beast. If not—then
the worst might happen.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a moment of brief suspense. All his nerves were
on the qui vive. Then he fired.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crack-ack!</p>

<p class='c000'>Two reports blended in one, for Barney fired at the same
moment. One moment the puma was in mid-air, then fell,
turning a dozen somersaults.</p>

<p class='c000'>When it ceased its terrific death struggle the two hunters
ventured to approach it. A more ferocious beast could not
be imagined.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Egad!” exclaimed Nicodemus, as he placed fresh cartridges
in his rifle, “the beast gave us quite a tussle. We’re
in high luck!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, I believe yez, sor!” agreed Barney. “I niver
was more skeered in me loife. One moment I thought it
was me the omadhoun was after, then I thought it was yesilf.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain laughed and kicked the body of the dead lion.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ve half a mind to take his skin!” he said, “but I don’t
believe it would pay. On my word, I think I see a mountain
antelope yonder. Let us try for him!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Both hunters started to creep up the mountain side.
Upon a distant spur of rock, sure enough, there stood a
goat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nearer they crept. It was necessary to proceed with the
greatest caution. These mountain goats were shrewd and
exceedingly wary.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it did not spy its human foes, however, until they
were within gunshot. Then both fired.</p>

<p class='c000'>One or more of the bullets hit the mark, for the goat gave
a spring in the air and fell.</p>

<p class='c000'>It came sliding and rolling down the mountain side, and
fell almost at the feet of the hunters. In a moment its
carcass was secured.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nicodemus was well satisfied.</p>

<p class='c000'>The object of the expedition had been accomplished, and
he did not care to go further. The goat was slung over his
shoulders, and he proposed to return to the air-ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>This, however, was speedily discovered to be not such an
easy matter. They had wandered far and somehow lost
their bearings.</p>

<p class='c000'>The region had all a peculiar sameness. It was some
while before Barney was able to decide the direction from
which they had come.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the points of the compass were finally settled, and
they set out upon the return. But though they journeyed
on for an hour, no sign of the air-ship was seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally they were brought to a halt by a deep chasm,
with sides too precipitous to descend. Here they were
forced to come to a dismayed halt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By whales!” exclaimed Nicodemus Beere, “here’s a
pretty how d’ye do! Where are we, Barney? Do ye know?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be me sowl, it’s sthuck I am intoirely,” replied the Celt.
“Shure, I thought we was going roight all the while.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, it’s plain that we were not,” replied the captain.
“We must make a back course or we’ll be lost.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“On me wurrud I belave it’s lost we are already,” declared
Barney. “Shure, I don’t know phwere I am.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Nicodemus was in a most uncomfortable frame of
mind. He stormed up and down the ledges excitedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is a fine mess!” he scolded. “What is going to
be the result? Darkness is coming on, and we will have to
spend the night here. We will stand a chance of being
eaten up by wild beasts.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Och hone!” gasped Barney, “do yez mean that, sor!
It’s bad luck fer us, to be shure.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Once again they set out along the mountain side.</p>

<p class='c000'>But again their quest was in vain. Each forgot that they
had ascended the mountain some distance in quest of goats
and that the air-ship consequently must be just below them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nightfall was coming on rapidly. Finally they abandoned
all idea of finding the air-ship. It was decided that
they must spend the night there.</p>

<p class='c000'>So they fell hastily to collecting fagots to make a fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon they had a large pile of them ready to light. They
knew that fire would keep wild beasts at bay, and this was
their safeguard.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under the shadow of a huge ledge they made their camp
and waited for daylight to come again. There was no sleep
for either that night. They could only wait the dawn.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='V' class='c008'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <span class='large'>THE CAPTAIN’S DISAPPEARANCE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile Frank had finished his repairing in the pilot-house
and began to arrange for resuming the journey once
more.</p>

<p class='c000'>He kept a lookout for Barney and the captain.</p>

<p class='c000'>But for some inexplicable reason they did not seem to
show up. Soon twilight came.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is queer,” he muttered, “they are making a long
trip. It is time that they should return.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dat am a fac’, sah,” averred Pomp; “reckon dat wild
I’ishman hab led dem away somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank fretted and fumed for a long time. Certainly they
had ought to be on hand by this time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Darkness came. Then he made up his mind that something
was wrong.</p>

<p class='c000'>Either something had befallen them or they were lost.
He credited the latter assumption.</p>

<p class='c000'>The air-ship was lit-up by the electric lamps and until a
late hour watch was kept. Then Frank went into the pilot-house.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We have got to go to their rescue,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly, Marse Frank!” exclaimed Pomp, “how we know
whar to look fo’ dem?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We must do the best we can,” said Frank. “You stand
by the searchlight, Pomp, and shoot its rays everywhere
through the mountains. I will manage the wheel.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp proceeded to obey orders. The air-ship rose, and
while Frank sent it along the mountain side Pomp operated
the searchlight.</p>

<p class='c000'>And here was where the two searchers got off the track.
As fate had it, Frank took the opposite direction, and, misled
by an angle in the mountain, passed directly around
to the other side.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here he followed the mountain wall in all directions.
The result was that he kept moving further and further
from the spot where Barney and the captain were in hiding
from the dreaded wild beasts.</p>

<p class='c000'>All night long the young inventor kept up the futile
quest.</p>

<p class='c000'>When daylight came he and Pomp were so thoroughly
worn out that it was decided to abandon the quest for a few
hours of needed rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly the air-ship descended and rested upon a
small shelf of rock jutting out from the mountain side.
Then Frank cast himself upon his couch and fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp remained on guard for a couple of hours. Then he
was relieved by Frank. The darky turned in for much
needed rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank could not remain idle.</p>

<p class='c000'>He sent the air-ship aloft and now saw his error of the
night. He had sailed completely around the mountain
peak and had been searching the wrong side of it all the
while.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Egad!” he muttered, “it is no wonder that I did not find
them. I hope they are yet safe. Remaining out all night
on these mountains is no joking matter.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He hastened to drive the air-ship around to the opposite
side of the peak again. As he did so the Spectre hung for a
moment over a deep chasm thousands of feet in depth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Involuntarily Frank glanced down into the chasm, and
then gave a great cry of astonishment and alarm.</p>

<p class='c000'>Far down in these awful depths he witnessed a thrilling
scene.</p>

<p class='c000'>A man hung over the fearful verge by the roots of a
clinging vine.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was knotted about his body, and he swung to and fro
over the verge, liable at any moment to be precipitated to
an awful death.</p>

<p class='c000'>It required but a moment for Frank to recognize the unfortunate
man. It was Barney O’Shea.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Celt’s face was deadly pale and streaked with blood.
His clothing was torn, and his appearance that of one who
had experienced a hard battle.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he saw the air-ship above him he waved his arm feebly.
Frank answered the signal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he allowed the Spectre to sink down into the chasm.
It was quickly close by the Celt, and Frank threw a noosed
rope over the rail.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Barney,” he cried, “what does this mean? How came
you in this position?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, sor, I had a fight with a panther,” replied the
Irishman. “We wint over the edge wid so much strugglin’,
and I caught by luck in these vines. The crayter is dead at
the bottom av this place.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have been preserved by Providence,” declared
Frank; “but where is the captain?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, sor, yez have the best av me there,” replied Barney.
“We siperated about midnight, an’ I’ve niver seen him
since.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few moments Barney was drawn aboard the air-ship,
and then he told his story.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a thrilling one.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed that he had fallen asleep at the little camp-fire
under the shelf or rock, where he and the captain had hoped
to spend the night safely.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly he was awakened by a terrific screech, and in
trying to gain his feet a monster panther had pounced upon
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He made a desperate fight with his knife, but the animal
dragged him a long ways over the rough ground. Then, as
Barney made a fresh battle with the beast, they had rolled
over the precipice, with what result we already know.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was all that the Celt could tell. What had become
of the captain he could not say. It was a puzzling matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, Frank proposed that they should return to the
spot where the camp had been made and look for some sign
of the missing mariner.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was easy to follow the trail over the rocks which was
marked with Barney’s blood.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then they came upon the camp. It presented only a few
burned fagots and a heap of ashes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nicodemus was gone. He had left no visible trail.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was strange enough.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp had now come on deck and assisted Frank and
Barney. But not the slightest clew could be found.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were various hypotheses to be advanced. It was
possible that the captain, being suddenly awakened by the
appearance of the panther, had taken fright and incontinently
fled. That in the darkness he had lost his way and
was somewhere in the region aimlessly wandering about.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not at all likely that he had been killed, devoured,
or dragged away by any wild beast as had Barney, else some
trace would have been left behind.</p>

<p class='c000'>A deeper mystery could hardly be imagined. But there
was no time to lose.</p>

<p class='c000'>The air-ship proceeded to skirt the mountain side, and
every cranny and nook was explored.</p>

<p class='c000'>But yet no sign of the lost captain was found. The day
wore on and it began to look as if another night would be
passed in the vicinity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure it’s very quare,” declared Barney. “I don’t see
phwat he should go away for at all for whin the baste was
afther me instid av himsilf.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was not like the captain,” declared Frank, “he would
rather have paused to give you aid.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“So I should think, sor. It’s moighty quare indade.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But at the eleventh hour the mystery was solved. The
air-ship dropped down the side of the peak a short distance,
and this brought into view a long jagged spur of rock
which shot out from the mountain wall and hung over an
abyss thousands of feet deep.</p>

<p class='c000'>And upon the very extremity of this there was seen the
figure of a man. He waved his arms as the air-ship approached.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By Jupiter!” exclaimed Frank, “that is Beere. How did
he get out there?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed, this question might well be asked. It was not an
easy one to answer.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed almost incredible that a man could climb so far
out on that awful pinnacle of rock. And once there, return
was clearly impossible.</p>

<p class='c000'>So it could be seen that the captain’s plight was a fearful
one. But the air-ship sailed down upon him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Heigho!” shouted Frank. “What are you doing down
there, captain?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s what I’ve been asking myself, mate,” replied the
mariner, “give me a lift before I fall.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank lowered the same rope with which he had hauled
Barney up.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few moments the captain was safe on the air-ship’s
deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>His story was a remarkable one.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How did I get there?” he exclaimed. “I couldn’t tell
ye. I only know that I went to sleep in the little camp with
Barney. When I woke up I was hanging on out there.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Somnambulism!” suggested Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I reckon so; I am subject to that. Sure to walk in my
sleep if I go to bed with too much on my mind.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whew!” exclaimed Frank. “You are hardly a safe
man aboard an air-ship then.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I reckon not. But—how did you make out, Barney?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain was astonished when he heard the account of
Barney’s adventures. He had seen nothing of the panther,
nor had he any recollection of anything until he came out
of his sleep to find himself on the projecting spur of rock.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, the affair was ended, and all were safe again
aboard the Spectre, which was a matter for congratulation;
so Frank at once proceeded to again direct the course of the
air-ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down among the valleys now the air-ship sailed. The
country, however, was wild and unsettled, though the scattered
villages of a few Indian natives were seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s about time for us to get a look at the region about
the Transient Lake,” declared Nicodemus.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can you see anything familiar about this region?”
asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” replied the old mariner. “Yonder is the range of
hills where the Paraguay River rises, if my eyesight does
not fail me. On the other side of them we first found human
beings.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” said Frank reflectively, “we don’t want to go
there.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” replied the captain; “steer west by south. I think
that is our best course.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The words were scarcely spoken when a great cry came
from Barney and Pomp, who were aft. Frank and Nicodemus
turned to behold an appalling spectacle.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='VI' class='c008'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <span class='large'>THE ANDEAN STORM.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>West of them there was a deep and narrow gorge between
high mountains. Down through this with the speed of a
race horse there came a tumbling funnel-shaped cloud.</p>

<p class='c000'>So swift did it come and so unexpected was it, that the
voyagers were wholly unprepared and taken by surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>But in that swift instant all realized what it meant.</p>

<p class='c000'>A storm in the Andes is a terrible affair. Darting among
the great peaks it sweeps with cyclonic fury through the
valleys, carrying destruction in its path until its force is
spent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such was now swooping down upon the air-ship like a
mighty bird of prey.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no time to get out of the way to make any
change in course. Barney and Pomp sprang into the forward
cabin, shutting the door behind them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank and the captain leaped into the pilot-house.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were not a moment too soon.</p>

<p class='c000'>The storm struck the air-ship like a thunderbolt. What
saved it from being totally destroyed was a literal wonder.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was utterly impossible for any of the voyagers to recall
what transpired in that period while the air-ship was
in the clutches of the hurricane.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank had turned the lever to send the air-ship above the
storm. But he had not done this quickly enough.</p>

<p class='c000'>The weight of the storm had kept it down. It was whirled
about like a top, dashed hither and thither madly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The voyagers were hurled about the interior like puppets.
Nothing could be seen beyond the windows, nor could
they even guess where they were being whirled.</p>

<p class='c000'>How long this lasted they were never able to guess.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank gave up all as lost. He had not the slightest faith
that the helices and masts would successfully resist the
shock.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the wind ceased for a moment its force, he expected
to be dashed to atoms upon the earth below.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the unexpected often happens.</p>

<p class='c000'>The storm departed almost as suddenly as it came. The
wind died out, the air-ship ceased whirling and the blackness
disappeared.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sun burst forth once more and all was again light.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney crawled out from under a heap of wreckage, and
Pomp relaxed a grip on the skylight frame.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank crept out from under the electric keyboard, and
Captain Beere appeared from the wine closet with a fragment
of the door in his hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Great whales!” he bellowed; “I’ve sailed the high seas
in many a hot typhoon, but I never saw the equal of this
one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We seem to be afloat,” said Frank, with an attempt to
straighten a crick in his neck.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he glanced out of the window and saw that the
helices were revolving furiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>The air-ship was speeding upward and frost was forming
on the windows. But Frank quickly checked the helices.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Spectre sank a mile or two very quickly and continued
going down until the gauge recorded an altitude of
two thousand feet. Then all went to the windows and gazed
out.</p>

<p class='c000'>The scene spread below was a startling one.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instead of tropical forests or craggy heights there was
visible nothing but a mighty expanse of water.</p>

<p class='c000'>As far as the eye could reach in all directions this was all
that could be seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Astounded, the voyagers regarded the scene for a time in
silence.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Frank cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“On my word I believe we have been carried clean over
the continent and out to sea.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, it’s the ocean,” averred Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly! we must hab trabeled pretty fast,” declared
Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Captain Nicodemus studied the scene below critically
and then said decidedly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is the big lake again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What!” exclaimed Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is the lake we’re looking for,” declared the mariner.
“We have made it at last, thanks to the storm.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was astounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have never heard of any body of water as large as this
in Central South America,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, I can’t help that,” said the captain logically;
“here it is.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You say this is the Transient Lake?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With redoubled interest the aerial voyagers now gazed
upon the great body of water below.</p>

<p class='c000'>None were disposed to dispute the old captain, and Frank,
scanning the horizon more intently, saw the faint haze of
the shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By Jove!” he exclaimed, “it is a big body of fresh
water. However, here we are. Now to recover the treasure.
What course shall we pursue, Captain Nicodemus?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The old captain was much excited.</p>

<p class='c000'>He walked up and down the deck, rubbing his hands and
studying the horizon.</p>

<p class='c000'>At length he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Steer west, skipper—due west.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank complied with this.</p>

<p class='c000'>The air-ship sailed westward for several hours. And still
the great expanse of water lay beneath. Frank reckoned it
full two hundred miles from shore to shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>At length the western shore became well defined.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now as they approached it, a curious thing was observed.
The waters of the lake seemed to have risen and
flooded a part of the country beyond, so that the water was
full of trees and tangled brush.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nicodemus was surprised.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This was not the case when we were here,” he declared;
“it is curious. I can see nothing of the shore where we
rested.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is under water,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, can you guess at the locality?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes. Yonder peak was north by west. Here—here was
about the spot where we camped. The gold mound should
be three miles or more in that direction out in the lake.”</p>

<p class='c000'>These facts established, the interest of all reached fever
height. The air-ship was held stationary over that spot.</p>

<p class='c000'>A discussion was now held as to the best course to be
pursued.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of course we can do no better than to wait for the
disappearance of the lake,” said Nicodemus. “That may
happen at any time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is there any regularity to the event?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That I cannot say,” replied the captain. “We were here
but a few weeks, and the lake disappeared and reappeared
only once in that time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have to suggest, then,” said Frank, “that we sail over
to that distant peak and wait there until some change
comes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The peak in question overhung the lake, so that its disappearance
could be instantly noted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The plan was adopted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon the Spectre was resting upon this mountain height.
A good spot was found for the air-ship to rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>Night now shut down rapidly. As all on board were
intensely weary, they retired early to rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney was left on guard. The night was black as Erebus.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Celt sat in the bow of the air-ship where he could
easily reach the valve of the searchlight. There was no
danger of his sleeping at his post.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the hours wore on, Barney relaxed his vigilance somewhat.
It was past the hour of midnight when an unlooked
for thing occurred.</p>

<p class='c000'>A curious sound came from the distance over the lake.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a strange sullen roar and a curious sound like the
suction of water through an orifice.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, that’s a queer sound,” he muttered. “Phwativer
can it be?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He listened again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he acted upon impulse and turned on the full glare
of the searchlight. The pathway of radiance shot out over
the lake.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney had expected to see the shimmer of the waters.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he was startled at the fact that they were not visible.
The glare of light showed only sand and rocks and
weeds.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pathway of radiance extended for fully a mile. But
nowhere was water visible.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tare an’ ’ounds!” gasped the Celt, “phwat the divil is
the maning av that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>For a moment he was stupefied.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the realization of a startling truth dawned upon
him. He sprang to his feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mither presarve us!” he muttered, “the lake has gone
an’ disappeared, as the captain said it would.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He started for the cabin to call Frank and the captain.
But before he reached the cabin stairs second thought impelled
him to change his mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Divil a bit,” he muttered; “there’s no nade av that.
Shure, they’ll see the thing fer thimsilves to-morrow, an’ to
chate thim av their sleep now wud be foolish enough.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So he went back to his post.</p>

<p class='c000'>He flashed the rays of the searchlight over the sandy bed
of the Transient Lake. Satisfied that there was no error,
and that the lake had really departed, he finally shut off
the rays and abandoned himself again to his duty of pacing
the deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>The night wore on.</p>

<p class='c000'>Usually Pomp would come on duty to relieve him before
the morning hour. But this night Barney had agreed to
keep the full watch, if Pomp would do the same the next
night, giving each a chance for a full night’s sleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>Toward morning Barney relaxed his vigilance and sat in
the cabin doorway, communing with his thoughts. It was
just daylight when he heard a movement below.</p>

<p class='c000'>He saw Frank Reade, Jr., cross the cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instantly he cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Och hone, Misther Frank, shure I’ve a surproise for
ye. The lake has gone intoirely, sor!”</p>

<p class='c000'>This assertion created a sensation.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='VII' class='c008'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <span class='large'>A STARTLING SURPRISE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Frank gave an exclamation and started for the stairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is that you say, Barney?” he cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, sor, the lake has gone!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank gave a loud shout.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Heigho, Beere!” he cried, “the time for action has
come. We are just in time. The lake has gone out.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Eh—w—what?” sputtered the captain, rolling out of his
berth. “You don’t mean that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yis, sor, for I saw it wid me own eyes!” cried Barney,
“shure, cum up an’ ye kin see fer yersilf.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain leaped into his trousers. Then he sprang up
the cabin stairs with Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a moment all were at the rail. Then there was an astounded
silence.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney’s hair fairly rose on end. He gazed down below,
then up at the sky, then around him. Then he gasped for
breath.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mither av Moses! Did ye iver see the loikes! Shure it
has cum back agin!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Both Frank and the captain looked sharp at the Celt.</p>

<p class='c000'>There below them was the sparkling surface of the lake.
It presented just the same appearance and was just as high
as when they had last seen it the night before.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Barney,” said Frank, severely, “have you been drinking?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Celt stuttered and stammered and acted very foolish.
But he managed to say:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be me sowl, Misther Frank, it was gone, and not an hour
since, sor. I saw the sand an’ the rocks ’an’ all, sor!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank and Nicodemus exchanged glances.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What time was it when you discovered the disappearance
of the lake, Barney?” asked Nicodemus.</p>

<p class='c000'>“About two o’clock av the mornin’, sor!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tell us all about it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney did this. Frank and the captain listened with
interest. When he had finished Nicodemus said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Frank, there is no doubt of it. The lake went out and
came back again while we were asleep.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It must be so,” agreed the young inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, sor, it’s thrue,” averred Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why didn’t you wake us up and tell us about it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“On me worrud, sor, I niver had a thought that it wud
cum back again, sor, an’ I med out to wait until mornin’
rather than disthurb yez sleep, sor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” said Frank, turning to Nicodemus, “it is hardly
likely that we could have accomplished anything anyway in
that brief time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is true,” agreed the captain. “We will wait for
another evacuation of the lake basin.”</p>

<p class='c000'>All that day the little party watched the lake. That
night all sat up until late to see if the lake would go out
again.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it did not. The next day brought no change, and
thus several days passed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Still the same smooth expanse of water smiled upon them
every morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>There seemed no reason for believing that it ever would
or could change its basin.</p>

<p class='c000'>A week passed thus.</p>

<p class='c000'>Waiting and watching of course grew extremely monotonous.
So after awhile diversions were indulged in to pass
away the time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hunting trips were made into the interior of the mysterious
country.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many strange things were seen, and once a glimpse was
had of a mighty cavern mouth far up in the hills, in which
there were grouped a dozen of giant men.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were no doubt of the giant race which inhabited
those mountains. It seemed as if they must be fully seven
feet in height and of enormous build.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our adventurers took good care to keep out of their way,
for a collision with them might not be pleasant.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two weeks drifted by.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the first of a series of thrilling events occurred.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nicodemus arose early one morning and walked around
the far shore of the lake.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was pacing the sands abstractedly when his eye caught
something in the sand.</p>

<p class='c000'>He paused with a gasp.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a footprint.</p>

<p class='c000'>Moreover it was that of a man who wore a hobnailed boot.
It could only prove one thing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Others were in the region and they were also from civilization.
Words cannot express the captain’s amazement.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By Neptune,” he muttered, “how did they ever find
their way to this out of the way place?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then other queries came to him. Who were they? What
brought them here, and how many were in their party?</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain’s curiosity was aroused.</p>

<p class='c000'>Prudence bade him return to the air-ship and secure the
co-operation of his companions. But powerful curiosity
overruled discretion.</p>

<p class='c000'>He bent down over the trail and followed it. A little further
on as he had expected, the footprints met with others.
For two miles he followed them along the shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he turned an angle in the shore and came upon a
startling scene.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was a camp in the verge of a clump of palms. A
dozen brawny men in white shirts, loose trousers and sombreros,
were sitting about smoking and talking.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the paraphernalia of a camp, with a train of mules,
was behind them. They had apparently been on the spot
for some while.</p>

<p class='c000'>Words can hardly express the sensations of the captain.</p>

<p class='c000'>He stared at the scene, and then a sharp ejaculation escaped
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By Neptune! it is Jerry Dooley!”</p>

<p class='c000'>His gaze was fixed upon a man who stood in the edge of
the camp talking with three others. He was a man of
smooth face, shifting gaze and stealthy manner. His appearance
was that of a sea-faring man.</p>

<p class='c000'>In him Nicodemus recognized one of the crew of the
wrecked ship, who had been a companion of his at the time
that the lake came back, and as Nicodemus had always believed,
had drowned the entire crew left at the mound of
gold.</p>

<p class='c000'>But there had been one exception. This was Jerry Dooley,
the ship’s steward. As fate had it, he had started himself
right after Nicodemus and Langley to go back to the
camp on an errand. He was overtaken by the waters of the
lake, but dashed high and dry upon an eminence on the lake
shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dooley had made ineffectual search for the camp, and not
finding it, finally started back for the Pacific coast.</p>

<p class='c000'>After many hardships he reached it and pluckily put to
sea in the ship’s boat left there. Good fortune became his.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was picked up by a coaster bound for Valparaiso and
later got a berth aboard an American ship of the line. Later
he went into the navy.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he had never forgotten the Transient Lake and the
mound of gold. He believed all his companions dead.</p>

<p class='c000'>He succeeded in the navy and became a lieutenant, finally
being retired on half pay. Having the leisure time he now
decided to carry out a long-cherished desire.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was to pay a visit again to the Transient Lake, and
if possible recover the buried treasure. He succeeded in
organizing a party.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a year they had floundered about in the swamps of
Paraguay, and finally crossed the wild ranges of Chuquisoca,
and by a stroke of luck found the lake.</p>

<p class='c000'>And here they were encamped and waited for precisely
the same thing that the aerial voyagers did, viz: the disappearance
of the lake.</p>

<p class='c000'>This much Captain Nicodemus guessed. He was so excited
at the outlook that he inadvertently stood out in full
view of the camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>And just then Dooley, chancing to look up, saw him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He gave a start and for a moment his face was livid.
Then he started toward Nicodemus.</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain saw that he had betrayed himself, so he did
not attempt to conceal himself. Instead he advanced to
meet the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dooley!” he exclaimed; “on my word, this beats all. I
thought you dead.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And I thought you dead, skipper,” declared the lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What—when—how—what are you here for?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The lieutenant looked sharply at the captain. In that
moment each understood the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have come back for the gold in the bottom of the
lake,” said Dooley.</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain stiffened visibly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you expect to get it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not unless the lake again changes its basin.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, umph! Let me see. Were not your companions
drowned when the lake returned that time?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They were.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But you—how did you escape?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Dooley told his story. Then he asked sharply:</p>

<p class='c000'>“But how did you get here? You have not been here ever
since?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hardly,” replied Nicodemus, quietly. “I have come
here for the same purpose as yourself, for the buried gold.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The two men gazed at each other. In that moment antagonism
was uppermost.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I suppose that gold belongs to whomever can recover it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Certainly not!” replied Nicodemus.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed!” said Dooley, somewhat staggered. “How do
you disprove that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Easy enough. My right to it is indisputable, and confirmed
by the law of prior discovery. The gold is mine!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Dooley drew a deep, sharp breath. Matters were becoming
strained.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I disagree with you,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Eh?” roared Beere.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do not agree with you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Just this: We have as much title to that gold as you.
It was to have been equally divided at the time. It shall
be so now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By what authority?” asked Beere.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The authority of fair play. We have come thousands of
miles, have dared death in every form, and we are not in a
mood to sacrifice the prime object of our expedition.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='VIII' class='c008'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE ATTACK ON THE AIR-SHIP.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Nicodemus had expected something of this kind from
the moment he had first seen Dooley on the spot. He knew
that trouble could not be averted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The latter rascal, for such he really was, was keen enough
to read all this in Beere’s face.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was backed by a dozen hardy men himself, and he did
not believe that the captain was so well supported. So he
was uppish.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beere gazed steadily at the other for a moment after this
virtual declaration of war, and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“The largest share of that gold belongs to me. You shall
have a fair share. Is not that fair enough?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My friend,” said Dooley bluffly, “mighty little of that
gold you’ll see, I can tell you. It belongs to me. I claim it
and shall divide it as I see fit.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You will?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are a scoundrel!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Easy! I can make trouble for you. Back of me are a
dozen faithful fellows who will do anything. It will not
pay you to dare me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Beere was now furious.</p>

<p class='c000'>He made a menacing gesture.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You atrocious rascal!” he gritted. “I’ve a mind to flog
you!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’re not aboard ship now!” sneered Dooley. “By the
way, I am inclined to believe that you are a dangerous character
and ought to be taken care of. Hey, boys!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He blew a shrill whistle. The result was electrical.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instantly the two men were surrounded. Dooley made a
quick sign, and heavy hands were laid on Beere.</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain saw in that moment that he was in bad hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rascally Dooley certainly meant him harm. The old
captain’s blood was up.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Avast, ye dirty lubbers!” he roared. “I’ll keelhaul
every mother’s son of ye if ye lay hands on me. Mark my
words!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tie him up!” yelled Dooley. “Seize him there!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Beere let out with two sledge hammer blows, which were
like the kick of a horse. A man went crashing down with
each blow.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he was overpowered.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was a strong man and fought furiously. But the
odds were too great. He was obliged to succumb.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dooley was exultant.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We have come too far, boys, to have any living man
stand between us and that gold.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The others cheered. Then the villain continued:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tie him up to that tree yonder. First, I want to learn
whether he has any companions or not.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he interrogated his prisoner.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tell me the truth, Beere,” he said, sternly; “how many
companions have you, and where are they?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You must learn that for yourself,” said Beere, firmly.
“I can give you no information.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A curse dropped from Dooley’s lips. He took a step toward
the prisoner, saying menacingly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’ll find a way to open your mouth. Before I’ve done
with you you’ll be glad enough to talk.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But Nicodemus was not to be intimidated, though the
situation was a serious one for him. He refused to say anything.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the villains organized a trailing party and followed
his footprints backward along the beach. When they had
reached a certain angle they looked up and beheld the air-ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was an astonishing spectacle to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>They managed to creep up near enough to the Spectre to
see three men aboard her, one of them colored, and then
they returned to their camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was easy for Dooley to decide upon a move.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We must capture that hurdy-gurdy,” he said; “how in
the world it got away up there on that shelf of rock, I do
not know.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The villain did not know that the Spectre was an air-ship.
He had fancied it some sort of water craft.</p>

<p class='c000'>He proceeded to arrange for a descent upon and the capture
of the air-ship that night. He felt sure of success.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile Frank and Barney and Pomp had been attending
to the routine of their duties aboard the Spectre.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was some while before the captain’s prolonged absence
was noted. Then Frank ventured to say:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you think anything has happened to Beere? He
ought to be here now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, that’s thrue!” cried Barney. “Phwere did he
go at all, at all?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I done seed him goin’ along dat shore early dis mornin’!”
declared Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then he is surely in trouble!” said Frank. “We had
better set out to look for him. Come on, Barney!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor picked up his rifle and flung himself
over the rail.</p>

<p class='c000'>“All roight, sor!” cried Barney, hastening to join him.
Frank turned to Pomp, saying:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Keep a sharp lookout, Pomp. We will be back as soon
as possible. Remember, we’re in a dangerous country.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yo’ kin be sure ob dat, sah,” affirmed Pomp. “Neber
fear, sah.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank and Barney were quickly on the beach. They
walked on until they came upon Nicodemus’s tracks. Then
a startling surprise was accorded them.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were other tracks.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By Jupiter!” exclaimed the young inventor in amazement,
“what does this mean? The captain has fallen in
with others and they are civilized also.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was nothing to do but to follow the trail. The result
was that, after two miles of patient tramping, they
came upon the camp of Dooley’s men just as the captain
had.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only they were wiser and kept out of sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was a praiseworthy precaution. Moreover they were
directly astonished to see Nicodemus tied to a palm tree. A
rascally-looking fellow was just organizing a party of a half
dozen armed men.</p>

<p class='c000'>It looked as if they were going to venture forth upon some
daring errand. A startling thought came to Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>These men were certainly foes. Their capture of Nicodemus
showed that. Was it not their purpose to attack the
air-ship?</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank’s first impulse was to beat a hasty retreat and give
them a hot reception. But second thought changed his
mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>He thought of Nicodemus and saw that he needed succor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pomp will be on the outlook,” he reflected; “he can
easily fool them. Our duty is here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So he whispered to Barney to crouch low in the bushes
and await developments.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were not long in coming.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dooley and five of his men, armed to the teeth, set forth
to capture the air-ship. This left five men in the camp with
the prisoner, Beere.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Nicodemus was in a very despondent state of
mind. Just as despair was getting a firm grip on him he
heard a sibilant whistle at his elbow.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was so low that it did not travel beyond his ears. He
turned his head eagerly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then a whisper came to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t get discouraged—we are here to rescue you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good!” returned the captain. “You missed me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“These fellows are our foes. They are led by Jerry Dooley,
one of my ship’s crew, who has come back here for the
gold. They will give us trouble.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney had crept up behind the tree. He skilfully cut
the prisoner’s bonds.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now, sor,” he whispered, “whin the omadhouns ain’t
lukin’ at all jest slip into the bushes and cum wid us.
Shure we must be afther gittin’ back to the air-ship.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right, Barney,” agreed the captain.</p>

<p class='c000'>And at the right moment he obeyed the suggestion. In
the undergrowth he joined Barney and Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>The trio ran hastily along the shore in the verge of the
palms. They had made several hundred yards before a loud
roar announced that their escape had been discovered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then came pursuit.</p>

<p class='c000'>But they had start enough to keep out of the way. And
right here Frank employed a stratagem.</p>

<p class='c000'>Showing themselves for a moment on the beach, the fugitives
next dashed into a copse near. Here they hid while
their pursuers ran by them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The danger was momentarily over. But the fate of the
air-ship now became the engrossing subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>Would Pomp be sufficiently on his guard to repel the attack?
But the question was the next moment answered in
a satisfactory manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>The distant rattle of firearms was heard.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They have made the attack,” cried Frank. “Now all
depends on Pomp.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Niver yez fear for the naygur,” cried Barney. “Shure,
he’ll fool thim aisy enough.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The rattle of the guns grew momentarily more rapid and
clear. It was plain that Pomp was giving them a hot reception.</p>

<p class='c000'>But that the overpowering numbers would result in the
capture of the air-ship would seem certain unless the darky
should employ different tactics. And this he was shrewd
enough to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seeing that the foe were preparing to charge upon him,
the darky acted accordingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>He sent the air-ship aloft instantly. His companions in
hiding below suddenly saw it appear just above them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hurrah!” cried Frank. “Pomp was on his guard. The
air-ship is safe.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It must be a surprise to Jerry Dooley,” said the captain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers, I hope the naygur will be afther seeing us,”
cried Barney. “It’s a foine pickle we’ll be in if he don’t.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I think he will,” said Frank. “Suppose we try a
signal!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor drew from his pocket a small battery
and a steel tube with a pneumatic chamber. He held this
tube up a moment and pressed a button.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a sharp ping, a recoil, and up into the air shot
a small ball of fire. Up it went, and exploding, fell in a
shower of sparks.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My electric rocket,” said Frank, explanatively. “I don’t
see how Pomp can fail to see that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Divil a bit!” cried Barney, with exultation. “See, shure
he’s got his eye on us already.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The air-ship came about and bore down rapidly to the
spot where the trio stood. Pomp was seen at the pilot-house
window.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down it sank as the darky saw them, and stopped not
fifty feet from the ground. Then the darky ran out and
threw over the gang ladder.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Huh! I’se drefful glad to fin’ yo’!” he cried with delight
in his voice.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='IX' class='c008'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <span class='large'>A FUTILE QUEST.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It is needless to say that the three adventurers lost no
time in climbing up the gang ladder.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were not a moment too soon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank had just cleared the rail when men burst from a
thicket and sent a hail storm of bullets upward. They rattled
on the steel hull of the air-ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Give it to ’em!” shouted Nicodemus, angrily. “They
deserve it richly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp grabbed rifles and rushed to the rail.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Frank cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wait! Do not take life unnecessarily! We are safe just
now. Let us have a talk with them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Taking care not to expose himself, Frank shouted over the
rail:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ahoy down there!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The firing had ceased, and a voice—that of Dooley—came
up in reply:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, what do you want?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you mean by this unprovoked attack upon us?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are our enemies!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How do you prove that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have you not come here to cheat us out of the gold
buried under the lake, and which justly belongs to us?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Neither of us are able to secure it just now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, but we shall be when the lake recedes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In that event, why have we not as much right to a share
of it as you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is neither here nor there. We lay claim to the gold,
and don’t propose to divide with anybody.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What a pig-headed fellow,” said Frank, angrily. “I’ve
a mind to teach him a lesson!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish you would,” said Nicodemus, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look here, my friend,” shouted Frank, “let’s have no
nonsense about this. That gold does not belong to you
more than it does to us. For that matter, if I should choose,
I could prevent your securing one jot of it. It is better for
you to talk reason at once!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The only reason I will talk with you,” said Dooley, obstinately,
“is that you go on about your business and leave
us and our affairs alone!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank turned from the rail.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is no use to talk with that fellow,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What shall we do?” asked Nicodemus.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will think up a plan,” said the young inventor, “in
the meanwhile our best plan is to sail over to the other side
of the lake and wait for it to recede. When it does we must
be first on the scene where the gold lies.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good!” cried Nicodemus; “if they attack us there——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then it will be time enough to retaliate!” declared
Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>And so the matter was settled.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Spectre sailed away across the arm of the lake and
landed upon the summit of a small hill. It would have required
several days’ journey for the Dooley gang to have
made the circuit around by the shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>So the aerial voyagers felt safe. But this new development
had put a different face upon matters.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, if the lake should again recede, the air-ship
could easily cover the three miles to the mound of gold before
the men on foot could.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank nor Nicodemus either cared for but a fair share of
the treasure. But the unfair and unreasonable conduct of
Dooley impelled them to seize the whole of it if they could.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another day and night passed and yet the lake presented
the same smiling and smooth appearance. But that afternoon
a curious thing happened.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney, who was on deck, noted a curious yellow cloud
rising from the west.</p>

<p class='c000'>It mounted upward rapidly and soon had assumed angry
proportions. The sun was hazy and the landscape took on a
sickly appearance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“On my word!” cried Frank, “it looks as if we were going
to have another Andean storm.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Jericho!” exclaimed Nicodemus, “don’t say that. We
had better anchor the air-ship hereabouts if that is true.”</p>

<p class='c000'>All watched the cloud until the whole western sky was
obscured. Then there was a distant rumble, lightning shot
across the heavens.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ground began to rock and pitch violently, trees and
shrubs swayed and were bent to the ground, the air-ship
was tossed about like a pebble, and no man could stay on
his feet a moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“An earthquake!” gasped Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers, wud yez luk at the lake!” cried Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>All gazed in that direction and were dumfounded at the
fearful spectacle presented.</p>

<p class='c000'>The lake was like one mighty whirlpool, and went swirling
about like a vast maelstrom. Its waters seemed to be receding
every second.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the white sands of the shore line began to widen.
Islands appeared in its surface.</p>

<p class='c000'>The truth was plain.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Transient Lake, impelled no doubt by the earthquake,
was about to make one of its periodical disappearances.</p>

<p class='c000'>Round and round swirled the waters. The ground had
now ceased shaking.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the yellow cloud continued to vomit lightning until it
had passed beyond the zenith.</p>

<p class='c000'>The aerial voyagers now all pressed to the rail and watched
the wonderful phenomenon of the lake’s disappearance.</p>

<p class='c000'>And, indeed, such it was.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lower and lower sank the swirling waters. Suddenly
they ceased their commotion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then they became like glass. In a few moments they
were like a mirror.</p>

<p class='c000'>But rapidly now they sank. From the distance there
came a strange noise like water running through a funnel.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was the sound Barney had remarked a few nights
before. Ten—twenty—thirty minutes elapsed, and then, as
far as the eye could reach, no water was to be seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The glistening sands and rocks were rapidly drying in
the sunlight. The Transient Lake had once more gone out.</p>

<p class='c000'>How long it would remain was uncertain. Hours, perhaps,
and maybe days. However, this was the time for
action.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now for the mound of gold!” cried Frank. “We shall
have to get our bearings from you, captain.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right!” cried Nicodemus, studying the shore a moment.
“North by east, skipper!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney started the air-ship forward in the direction indicated.
Soon the lake bed was beneath them.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the Spectre sailed on over the sands, suddenly Nicodemus
clutched Frank’s arm and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“There they are!”</p>

<p class='c000'>A body of men were seen rushing rapidly across the lake
bed. They were Dooley and his gang.</p>

<p class='c000'>They could not help but see the air-ship, and even at
that distance fired a number of shots at it. But of course
they were without effect.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile the Spectre rapidly left them out of sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>Three miles was a distance easily covered by the air-ship,
and suddenly Nicodemus clutched Frank’s arm and
cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is the spot! Between those round hills! See it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank sprang to the keyboard and taking the lever from
Barney, steered the air-ship down between the little hills of
wet sand.</p>

<p class='c000'>A moment later the Spectre rested on terra firma.</p>

<p class='c000'>And there was the stone mound for a fact. It was just
as the party had left it years before, so Nicodemus declared.</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain was so excited that he hardly knew what to
do.</p>

<p class='c000'>He finally managed to procure a shovel and with Frank
climbed over the air-ship’s rail.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few moments the two men were alongside the mound.</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain hastily dropped his shovel and climbed to the
top of the mound. He removed the stone cap and peered
down into the place.</p>

<p class='c000'>He remained in this position for a long time and Frank
had thought of speaking to him, when he suddenly arose.</p>

<p class='c000'>His face, as he turned it toward Frank, was white as
chalk.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By whales!” he said huskily, “it is not there, Frank!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not there?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The gold—the gold is gone!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was so overcome with surprise and dismay that for
a moment he could say nothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Nicodemus climbed down and faced his companion.
His expression of face was strange to see.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you sure it is not there?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain nodded.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I could see every corner of the cavity,” he said. “It is
not there.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What! Who could have removed it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain gave a sudden start and smote his knee.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why did I not think of it?” he exclaimed. “Of course
the ship’s crew did it while Langley and I were on our way
to the camp.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank’s face lit up.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is probably the truth,” he agreed. “Why didn’t
we think of it before? Doubtless they removed the gold
just before they were overtaken and drowned.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In that event——”</p>

<p class='c000'>Nicodemus paused. Frank finished the sentence.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What did they do with it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>This was a question not easily answered. A close search
of the vicinity failed to disclose any evidence of gold.</p>

<p class='c000'>If it had been deposited just outside the mound and left
there, no trace of it could be found.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the other hand, it did not seem possible that the fated
men could have carried such a quantity of the precious
metal any distance away with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>If they had, then it must be found with their bones somewhere
in the vicinity.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a possibility that in the intervening years
some other parties had visited the spot and carried off the
gold. But this was only a faint chance.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, one fact was patent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The gold was gone.</p>

<p class='c000'>What had become of it? Certainly it could not have
taken wings and flown away of itself. The two gold seekers
were completely mystified, and knew not what to do.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='X' class='c008'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <span class='large'>A COMPROMISE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>However, time was valuable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dooley and his men were momentarily nearing the spot.
A conflict with them must be avoided.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Frank first suggested that a thorough search of the
vicinity be made.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was done.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every suspicious looking sand heap, far and near, was
thrown over. No gold was found.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was speedily seen that the quest was destined to be like
looking for a needle in a haystack.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a reasonable supposition that the ship’s crew had
removed the gold, and had started for the shore with it when
overtaken by the flood. To find it now, or their bones, would
require a long and patient search.</p>

<p class='c000'>An hour had already slipped by. Dooley and his men
could not be far away.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within a radius of several hundred yards a thorough
search was made.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then distant shouts announced the arrival of Dooley.
The aerial voyagers retired aboard the air-ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then they tried in vain to consider the best and most
logical move.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Confound these chaps!” said Frank, angrily; “they are
delaying us badly and making it as difficult for themselves
to recover the gold as for us!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They ought to be given a lesson,” said Nicodemus.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, but I would have to redden my hands with their
blood!” said Frank, “which I do not wish to do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is true. But how are we going to dispose of
them?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is a problem.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dooley gang had now come into view upon a sand
hill near. There they halted and regarded the air-ship in</p>

<p class='c000'>The aerial voyagers every moment expected a shower of
bullets.</p>

<p class='c000'>But to their surprise these did not come. Dooley changed
his tactics, very likely upon the cardinal principle that discretion
is the better part of valor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down from the height came two men carrying a white
rag on a gun barrel. One of these was Dooley himself.
When within speaking distance, they halted.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ahoy the air-ship!” shouted Dooley.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ahoy!” replied Nicodemus.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We want to parley.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Spout away!”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a moment of silence. Then Dooley resumed:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have reconsidered my determination of a few hours
ago in regard to the treasure. On the whole I believe a just
division no more than fair!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Nicodemus turned with a gasp to Frank:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, of all assurance,” he exclaimed, “the scoundrel
thinks we have the gold, and, of course, is cunning enough
to see that this is his only hope of getting any of it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He is a scamp,” said Frank, “evidently he thinks we are
soft.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But that is his mistake.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Rather!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What shall I tell him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let me talk with him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank went to the rail.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So you have really changed your mind, Mr. Dooley!”
with sarcasm.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I was a little hasty,” replied the villain; “I did not
consider the matter sufficiently.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, you probably think you are dealing with fools.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Eh?” gasped the villain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We have not the slightest idea of adhering to the terms
suggested at this late day.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What! You are not going to keep all that gold yourself?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We have not got it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Words cannot depict Dooley’s utter amazement.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not got it?” he repeated.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We have not.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why—who has then?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We do not know.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then it is gone?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Loud and bitter curses broke from Dooley’s lips. He ran
forward almost to the air-ship’s rail.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then there has been some treachery at work,” he declared—“some
hocus-pocus game. I tell you there is the
mound where the gold was——”</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned suddenly and sprang upon the mound. A
glance into the interior satisfied him.</p>

<p class='c000'>With livid face he descended. He came nearer to the
air-ship’s rail.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where can that gold have gone?” he asked, huskily;
“has some other party been here before us?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I cannot answer that question,” replied Frank; “but one
thing is certain, the gold is gone. Our theory is that the
ship’s crew departed for the shore with it and were overtaken
by the tidal wave on the way.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In that case the gold is with their bones.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A light of hope lit up the villain’s face. He averted his
gaze, and continued shrewdly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“We must search for it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” replied Frank, “that is the only way. But if we
are to be foes all the while——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, no,” cried Dooley, craftily; “we will not fight each
other. It shall be agreed that whoever finds the gold there
shall be a fair division.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will you swear to that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right,” said Frank, sternly; “but now let me impress
upon you one fact. We have the best of the situation.
If you attempt any treachery or go back on your agreement,
I’ll exterminate the whole of you. With my air-ship I can
do it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The rascal’s shifting gaze met Frank’s a moment. He
could not help but see that the young inventor was in earnest.
So he said with an affectation of servility:</p>

<p class='c000'>“You need have no fear. I always stand by my agreement.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Dooley went back to his men. Frank turned back from
the rail and met the approving gaze of Nicodemus.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You handled him well, Frank,” said the captain, approvingly.
“Nothing could have been better.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now we can search for the gold with safety.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp took his position at the wheel and keyboard. Barney
and Frank and the captain were to prosecute the search.</p>

<p class='c000'>Already Dooley’s men were at work. They were scattered
in all directions digging up the sand and following every
sign of a trail.</p>

<p class='c000'>Alighting from the air-ship, our trio of adventurers went
forward.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Beere’s hypothesis was that the men must have
set out with the gold in the direction of the camp. So they
proceeded that way.</p>

<p class='c000'>Long and persistent and careful was the quest. Finally
the day drew to a close.</p>

<p class='c000'>As it was useless to attempt the quest in the darkness,
Frank and his companions returned to the air-ship. The
others bivouacked near.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our adventurers were extremely weary with their day’s
work. As soon as they had partaken of the hearty meal prepared
by Pomp it was proposed to turn in.</p>

<p class='c000'>And this they did. Pomp was left on guard, to be relieved
by Barney in the early morning hours.</p>

<p class='c000'>The darky paced the deck until long past midnight. Then
he heard a low, sibilant whistle come from the gloom. In a
moment his rifle hammer rose.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Who am dar?” he asked, sharply.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Easy, nigger! don’t get excited,” came back the reply.
“I’m only one of Dooley’s men.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wha’ yo’ want?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s durned lonesome up thar. Hev you got a chaw of
terbacker?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp saw nothing in this request that could imply harm.
The natural good-fellowship of man to man warmed within
him, and he was too generous a soul not to reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Reckon I hab, sah. Cum down yere an’ I gib yo’ a
hunk!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank yer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A hulking form came down from the gloom to the air-ship’s
rail. A grimy hand clutched the tobacco.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ugh! that’s good terbacker. Reckon you ain’t found no
gold yet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not a bit,” returned the darky; “don’ keer much fer
sich stuff mahself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Jest my sentiments presactly. I wouldn’t give thet terbacker
fer the hull of it. Any objections if I sit up thar
wid ye? I’m powerful lonesome an’ wish I was back in
Charleston.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You from Charleston, eh?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp hesitated a moment. Yet he could see no harm
after all. He was armed, the other was not. Neither did
he believe any treachery was intended.</p>

<p class='c000'>So the fellow, who gave his name as Jack Bowler, able
seaman, came over the rail, and the two had a social chat.
An hour drifted by.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp had waxed real friendly with his new companion
and was pleased to be able to have some one to help him
while away the night hours and help keep guard as well.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fellow told many entertaining stories of life upon the
high seas, and all went smooth as a marriage bell for a
time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly Jack Bowler asked:</p>

<p class='c000'>“What time are ye relieved?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“About three o’clock, sah,” replied Pomp; “dat I’ishman
he gib me a chaince to sleep den.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Bowler knocked the ashes from his pipe. Then he leaned
over against Pomp, and whispered:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look forward there! Don’t ye see somebody?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp turned his head in the direction indicated. Fatal
move it proved for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next moment the world swam about him, and then he
knew no more.</p>

<p class='c000'>With terrific force Bowler had struck him over the head
with a heavy iron instrument. The negro’s head was proverbially
hard, but it was not hard enough for that.</p>

<p class='c000'>In an instant Bowler was upon his feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>He took a step toward the cabin and listened. Then he
gave a shrill, hardly audible whistle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down through the gloom from the camp above came a
number of dark forms. Over the rail they came.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of them whispered to Bowler:</p>

<p class='c000'>“You did your work well, Jack. The rest are in the
cabin, are they?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are, cap’n. We ought to make sure of ’em in their
sleep. Dead men tell no tales.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XI' class='c008'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <span class='large'>A TREACHEROUS GAME.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>But Dooley, for he it was, said sharply:</p>

<p class='c000'>“No! You mustn’t kill one of them. I want them held
for prisoners. I have a purpose in view!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right!” said Bowler, sullenly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Toward the cabin door the interlopers crept. In a jiffy
they had taken possession of every part of the air-ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>A terrible peril hung over the heads of our sleeping voyagers,
and yet they slept on, all unsuspecting it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., was awakened from his slumbers by a
savage clutch at the throat. Strong hands forced him down
and bound him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain made a terrific resistance but was overpowered.
Barney was also served the same.</p>

<p class='c000'>The aerial voyagers were thus all made prisoners in a
twinkling. It was a sudden turning of tables.</p>

<p class='c000'>The jubilation of Dooley can hardly be described in
words.</p>

<p class='c000'>That the villain’s plans should have succeeded so well
was remarkable.</p>

<p class='c000'>He glowered at Frank Reade, Jr., saying:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, now, ye can afford to be a little more civil with
me, can’t ye? Oh, I tell ye, Jerry Dooley is a hard man to
beat!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are a treacherous dog,” said Frank, angrily, “after
making a truce, to treat us thus.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All is fair in war,” quoted the wretch. “You are lucky
to have been spared your lives.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you expect to gain by this trick? We have
none of the gold.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What have we not gained?” exclaimed the villain, exultantly.
“Only think—the wonderful air-ship is ours, to become
freebooters of the skies if we choose, and the inventor is
our hostage.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank smiled grimly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So you intend to make use of the air-ship?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You will find it not an easy machine to manage, I
think.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, but that is why I spared your life. You shall manage
it for us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed!” said Frank with anger. “You have reckoned
without a host. I shall do nothing of the kind.”</p>

<p class='c000'>An ugly light shone in Dooley’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You won’t, eh?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, we shall see. You may be induced to change your
mind. Make no rash announcements!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, for a moment of liberty,” muttered Frank, gnashing
his teeth. “I would pluck that rascal’s wings for him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish you had it, Frank,” said Nicodemus; “is there no
way we can turn the tables upon them?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We can only wait and hope,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney was raving and raging furiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s the stupid work of that naygur,” he cried angrily.
“Shure av they’ve finished him it’s small loss, afther givin’
us roight inter the hands av the inemy, bad cess to him!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile the gold seekers had overrun the air-ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no part of it to which they did not penetrate.
Everything on board was subject to scrutiny.</p>

<p class='c000'>No move was made, however, to change the position of the
air-ship until daylight came.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Dooley and several of his companions undertook to
make an examination of the electrical machinery.</p>

<p class='c000'>It probably occurred to them that they might fathom its
construction and learn to operate the air-ship themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>But they were bewildered with all its intricacies and were
speedily obliged to abandon that idea. They finally went
into the pilot-house and began trifling with the keyboard.</p>

<p class='c000'>And right here they made a mistake. For by an inadvertence
Bowler pressed the helice lever wide open.</p>

<p class='c000'>What happened was a literal surprise to all.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a terrific, whirring sound, and up into the air
shot the air-ship. Bowler did not know how to press the
lever back and could not therefore check the craft’s ascent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Both he and Dooley rushed out on deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>They stared down at the rapidly receding earth, half in
fright. As it happened none of the other gold-seekers were
aboard.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dooley was angry.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What the deuce did you do that for, Bowler?” he cried.
“Now undo your work lively.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can’t do it, sor!” replied the sailor, as he tried in vain
to reverse the lever. It would not work.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is a way to do it,” cried Dooley, angrily. “Confound
you for a blockhead! We shall soon get to heaven
at this rate. Let me see it, you ass!”</p>

<p class='c000'>But Dooley had no better luck! Still upward raced the
air-ship. The two rascals were in a state of terror.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cold perspiration oozed from their pores and they trembled
as if with the ague.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I didn’t mean to do it, skipper,” declared Bowler,
aghast; “it was an accident. Won’t we ever get back to the
earth?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not at this rate,” huskily declared the senior villain.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now an alarming state of affairs ensued. The air
grew so rare that their eyeballs began to ache and cold chills
seized them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Great Jericho!” gasped Dooley. “I can’t stand this.
I’ve heard it said that when you get a certain number of
miles up in the air you can find no air to breathe and you
must stifle.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Great lobster pots!” wailed the terrified Bowler; “stop
the thing some way.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can’t,” said Dooley, in despair.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can!” came a calm voice from the cabin. Dooley
wheeled as if shot.</p>

<p class='c000'>In that instant he saw deliverance, and wondered why he
had not thought of it before.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, surely!” he exclaimed, “here is the man who made
the condemned flying machine. Why didn’t I think of it.
Tell me, sir, how shall I stop her ascending.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You cannot do it,” replied Frank, calmly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can’t?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, sir!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do it then, for the love of heaven. We shall perish in a
few moments if you don’t.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How do you expect me to do it, tied up as I am?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Dooley hesitated. It was plain that he feared a trick.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will you agree——” he began.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I agree to nothing,” said Frank, sharply. “You are two
to one. Cut my bonds quickly, or we’ll all strangle before we
are aware of it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The villain hesitated no longer.</p>

<p class='c000'>With a quick spring forward he cut Frank’s bonds. The
young inventor leaped to his feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a moment he reached the keyboard. He quickly shut
off the current, and the air-ship fell.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down she sank until the awful pressure on the lungs
was removed.</p>

<p class='c000'>All felt easier.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Dooley rushed into the pilot-house with a rope in
his hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Make no resistance,” he said, threateningly, “or you will
die! You are our prisoners!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have offered no resistance,” said Frank, coolly; “but I
ask that you do not tie my hands again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you do, I cannot operate this air-ship, and that will
be the worse for you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This was really an evasive answer upon the young inventor’s
part, and he was casting about in his mind what
move it was best to make to turn the tables on his foe.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Eh!” exclaimed Dooley; “is it necessary for you to hold
your hand on that brass shaft?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is!” said Frank coolly. “See? if I take my hand off,
it will stop the air-ship!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The air-ship did stop. But Frank adroitly shifted the
lever when he took his hand from it. This completely deceived
the villain.</p>

<p class='c000'>He hesitated a moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he drew a revolver.</p>

<p class='c000'>He seated himself in a chair in the pilot-house door. He
placed the weapon on his knee:</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right!” he said, coolly; “keep your hand on that
thing, then. If you take it off or make a move to play any
gun game you shall die!”</p>

<p class='c000'>For a moment Frank felt that he was worsted. The villain
certainly had the best of him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then an idea came to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>There would be some risk to the move. But without some
risk he could hope to gain no victory.</p>

<p class='c000'>While he held his hand on the lever he managed with his
other hand to connect a small wire with the dynamo connections
and the steel framework of the pilot-house.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dooley leaned against the door frame, which was also of
steel. Frank’s hope was to suddenly send a current from the
dynamos strong enough to traverse the steel frame and shock
he villain into insensibility.</p>

<p class='c000'>So he carefully worked with this end in view. Dooley did
not suspect a thing.</p>

<p class='c000'>He saw Frank arranging the wires, but imagined all the
while that this was only some mechanism of the air-ship
which it was necessary to regulate.</p>

<p class='c000'>As long as he held the drop on Frank as he did he felt
comparatively safe.</p>

<p class='c000'>But right here was his mistake. Had he ordered the
young inventor to stop twisting the wires under the keyboard
the situation would have changed in his favor. He
failed to do so.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hence his defeat.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was all executed very swiftly and silently. The connection
was made and Frank turned to the villain, saying,
pleasantly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“We are half a mile from the earth now!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Jericho!” gasped Dooley. “What a drop that would
be!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, a comfortable one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Eh? I should think it would be a terrible one. Would
it not mean death?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Possibly. That would depend upon the shock which
would be something like—this!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank made the connection.</p>

<p class='c000'>In that swift second the steel frame received the full force
of the dynamos. The villain could not know what struck
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He sank down in a lifeless heap. Frank switched the current
off, and with a leap gained his side. He picked up the
revolver and covered Jack Bowler, who had come rushing
out of the cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Great guns!” roared the sailor; “what’s the matter with
the skipper—eh—what’s this?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hands up, on your life!” cried Frank, sternly, “or
you’re a dead man. I have the drop.”</p>

<p class='c000'>One moment Bowler hesitated. His face turned ashen
pale.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he saw that the game was up. There was nothing for
it but to surrender.</p>

<p class='c000'>So up went his hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By the gunnels!” he ejaculated, “you have got to windward
of us after all. It’s good pluck.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank made Bowler follow him into the cabin, while he
cut the bonds of Nicodemus and Barney. Then both prisoners
were bound. It was not likely that Dooley would come
to very soon.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XII' class='c008'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE END OF THE STORY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>All this while poor Pomp had been lying insensible upon
a heap of mats in the after cabin, where he had been dragged
and left.</p>

<p class='c000'>But now the darky began to come out of his faint.</p>

<p class='c000'>The blow upon the skull had inflicted no serious wound,
and he must be all right again shortly. But for a time he
was sick and dizzy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank and Barney found him and gave him some stimulants.
He very quickly recuperated.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he remembered his experience with Bowler on the
deck. He felt somewhat crestfallen.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Frank said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s all right, Pomp; you meant well, but the fellow
was treacherous. Next time don’t get caught.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yo’ kin jes’ bet on dat!” cried the darky. “I won’t
trust nobody aftah dis.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It is needless to say that the aerial voyagers were delighted
with the result of the affair. Their deliverance was due
to Frank’s shrewdness and marvelous ingenuity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two prisoners were confined in the after cabin. But
it was now a question as to what it was best to do with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Suppose we go down and talk with their companions!”
said Nicodemus; “perhaps they will make up their minds to
behave themselves and let us alone after this!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well,” agreed Frank. “We will try that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So down sank the air-ship. The gold seekers were seen
grouped below in a state of much excitement.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank went to the rail and opened a parley with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We have your two leaders, Dooley and Bowler, as prisoners!”
declared the young inventor. “We want to know
if you are going to play any more treacherous games upon</p>

<p class='c000'>The gold seekers were evidently astonished at the turning
of tables in so unexpected a manner.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But finally they came to Frank’s terms and made fervid
vows never to trouble the air-ship or its party again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their spokesman said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“To tell ther truth, mister, we don’t believe in ther story
of ther hidden gold an’ we’re sick of the whole thing. We’re
goin’ back to Para.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very good!” said Frank. “I will set your leaders free
upon that condition.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he went into the cabin and talked with Dooley and
Bowler. They readily agreed to Frank’s terms.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall follow you as far as the shore of the lake,” declared
the young inventor; “if you dare to return I will
drop dynamite bombs upon you and destroy you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Dooley was satisfied.</p>

<p class='c000'>He saw that it was of no use to attempt to cope with the
voyagers. Moreover, he had lost faith in the existence of
the treasure.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was in fact sick of the whole job and decided to return
to America at the first chance. So he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll do as you say. I’m quits on this thing. It’s an
accursed country, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A short while later the two villains returned to their companions.
They at once started for the shore of the lake.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank decided not to accompany them, for he saw that
Dooley was in earnest.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the villain dropped from the air-ship, Frank said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“As an extra incentive, I will promise this, in spite of
your bad treatment of us. If we find the gold I will overtake
you and give you a fair division.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Dooley hung his head and muttered abashed thanks.
Then he and his party were off.</p>

<p class='c000'>The aerial voyagers continued the quest for the gold. All
that day they explored the sandy basin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Toward night a find was made.</p>

<p class='c000'>A number of human bones were mixed up with several
hundred ingots of the yellow stuff. It was taken aboard the
air-ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank estimated its value.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is about thirty thousand dollars in the pile,” he
said, “there are twelve in Dooley’s party and four in ours.
That will make about two thousand each on a fair division.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are not entitled to any of it,” snapped Nicodemus.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps not,” said Frank, “but we have banished them
from the search and therefore ought to divide. At any rate
I have promised it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I don’t kick,” said the captain, cheerfully; “I am
satisfied. It was not the gold I cared for so much as to
solve the mystery of this lake.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And that we are now at liberty to do,” said Frank; “we
will first overtake Dooley and his men and divide. Then
we will do a little exploring.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With this decision none found fault. So Frank took his
leave of the treasure basin.</p>

<p class='c000'>The gold seekers were overtaken on the shore of the lake.
They were astonished at Frank’s generous announcement.</p>

<p class='c000'>And when the gold was turned over to them Dooley wrung
Frank’s hand and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’re the only square man I ever met in my life. I
like your style. I’m going ter turn over a new leaf an’ do
better.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Dooley and his men set out to the eastward for the
head waters of the Paraguay where they had boats. None
of the aerial voyagers ever saw them again.</p>

<p class='c000'>But one thing more now remained to be done to complete
the success of the trip.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was to find the source of the Transient Lake and if
possible discover an explanation of its curious appearance
and disappearance.</p>

<p class='c000'>For full one hundred of the two hundred miles of its
width the air-ship sailed over the lake. They were now very
near the centre.</p>

<p class='c000'>And here a mighty circular bowl-shaped basin was seen.
It had curious galleries leading down into the earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>These were cut out of the solid rock. This basin covered
hundreds of acres. The air-ship was here brought to a
stop.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here,” said Frank, positively, “this is the outlet of the
lake, if anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Nicodemus gave the place a critical glance. Then he
said succinctly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Skipper, you’re right!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And as fate had it, while they were watching the curious
basin, a strange sound began to arise from it.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a dull, distant, hollow booming, and then suddenly
little channels of water began to appear in the rock galleries.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, it’s afther comin’!” cried Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>With interest the aerial voyagers watched the phenomenon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly from an orifice in the centre of the basin there
shot up to the height of fifty feet a great column of water.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then in an incredibly short space of time from all the
galleries there rushed forth great seething volumes, swift as
the rush of Niagara.</p>

<p class='c000'>And once full, the great basin overflowed in a second,
sending a mighty tidal wave across the country at race-horse
speed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Small wonder that the ship’s crew had been overtaken and
overwhelmed. Nothing could have outstripped that line of
swiftly rolling water.</p>

<p class='c000'>On all the wide earth Frank and his companions thought
there could be no phenomenon to equal this.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was without parallel. Within the incredible space of an
hour the Transient Lake, tranquil and placid, was once
more restored to its basin.</p>

<p class='c000'>The air-ship hung silently over it. Birds shot across its
surface, and small fish played in its limpid depths.</p>

<p class='c000'>Above, the sky was calm and serene. A fierce tropical
heat beat down upon all.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Nicodemus turned to Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, skipper,” he said. “What do you think of it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank drew a deep breath.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is a wonderful freak of mighty nature,” he said. “I
am satisfied. Let us go home!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Home!”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a magic word just now. The aerial voyagers had
accomplished their project, and had explored the Transient
Lake.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had yet a mighty distance to travel, and after all
there is no place like home.</p>

<p class='c000'>So Frank turned the course of the air-ship eastward.</p>

<p class='c000'>A farewell look was taken at the mysterious country and
its Transient Lake.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the air-ship sailed away.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a long journey from the Andes to the Atlantic.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed an eternity of jungle, stream, and forest of
hideous marsh and barren plain ere the tossing waters of the
stormy ocean were seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then a course was shaped northward along the coast.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stops were made briefly at Santos and Rio Janeiro. Then
the South American coast was left behind.</p>

<p class='c000'>On sailed the air-ship over the West India Islands toward
the coast of Florida.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, there’s no place loike the United States afther
all,” declared Barney, “savin’ mebbe ould Oireland.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Huh!” exclaimed Pomp; “yo’ allus hab to place dat lily
bit of an island befo’ eberyfing else.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers, an’ phwy shouldn’t I?” asked Barney, sharply;
“ain’t it the truth, to be shure?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If dey grow such tings as yo’ dar, wild, I kain’t say I
fink it am anyfing but a berry lily green spot on de face ob
de yairth,” averred Pomp, solemnly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney was tired in a moment. He saw the fun lurking in
the corners of Pomp’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was all ready for a ruction and this assertion touched
him off.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So yez think it is only a little grand spot, eh?” asked
the Celt, rolling up his sleeves. “Well, grane is not hurtful
to the eyes, I’ve heard tell, loike the black yez get in Afriky.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wha’ yo’ know ’bout Afriky?” exclaimed Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do yez know about Oireland?” spluttered Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“All I knows ’bout it is jest wha’ yo’ hab tole me, an’
dat am enuff,” sniffed Pomp. “Wha’ yo’ got yo’ sleeves
rolled up fo’?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, I don’t allow any mon to insult me or me native
land,” said the Celt, hitching up his trousers; “here’s
phwat backs me up.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He shook a fist in Pomp’s face. The darky dodged, and
the Celt made a biff at him. Then they closed in an exciting
encounter. Long and hard it was, but as it would have been
impossible to injure either one of their tough skins and
hardy frames by any dint of such pounding and wrestling,
they finally emerged from the encounter hardly the worse
for it.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the honor of each was satisfied, and their mania for
wrestling as well.</p>

<p class='c000'>In due course of time the Gulf of Mexico was crossed, and
one day Captain Nicodemus sighted Key West.</p>

<p class='c000'>The voyagers could not refrain from a jolly cheer at the
sight of their native land.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon the air-ship was sailing over the great swamps of
Okeechobee, and then swept over the great orange groves
and plantations of the sandy state. Georgia, South and
North Carolina followed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Along the Atlantic coast the voyagers journeyed until
finally the mouth of the Chesapeake came into view, and
later the Potomac. Then they hung over the Capitol city
and steered west for Readestown.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great journey was ended.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Transient Lake and the mysterious country had been
visited and were now history in the minds of the aerial
voyagers. They had also brought home some of the gold.</p>

<p class='c000'>All were satisfied and this was enough. Captain Nicodemus
embraced Frank gratefully for this, his last voyage.
Then he returned to his home.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., Barney and Pomp are yet in Readestown.
The young inventor is studying up new things which
we may hear from at some future day.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
